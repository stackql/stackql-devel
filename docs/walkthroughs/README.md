# `stackql` walkthroughs

All markdown documents hereunder, execept those named `README.md`, 
are **provably working** examples of `stackql` in action.
These materials serve as useful examples and reference materials for
using `stackql`.  If you have some use case that you would like to see added here; please let us know! 


All walkthrough files are testable with CI, leveraging annotations (eg: code block info strings)
in order to setup, run, verify and tear down testing scenarios.  The tests *can* be run:

- Locally, on your own machine.  Thats the whole idea; please mix and match and let us know any ideas thast occur.
- Directly from CI.  Reports are generated and archived.
- From test harnesses, such as robot framework.  This has not yet been implemented.
