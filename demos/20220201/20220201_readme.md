## TODO

- [x] handle all media types known -- non of our existing providers have much on offer right now, encapsulated response body processing, defer this mostly to later.
- [x] supply multiple provider configs at init time
- [x] supply secrets / selected config via env vars
- [x] guard logic for `openapistackql` graph traversal -- shortcutted to defer / recover pattern
- [x] refactor `openapistackql` to external package
- [x] fix plan cache request bug -- suspiciously looks to have fixed itself, added build flag to disable if required at later time. 
- [x] fix unit test duration issue
- [x] proper integration testing plan at least documented -- high level only.
- [ ] high level description of `core` in LATEX
- [ ] high level description of GC in LATEX
- [x] make single object `get` repsponses "selectable"
- [x] enable profiling for exec
- [x] identify performance bottlenecks
