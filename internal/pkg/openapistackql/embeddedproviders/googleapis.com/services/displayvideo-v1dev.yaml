            `Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource. For other
            methods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx`
            is the original method name. For example, if the original method name
            is `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is `TakeSnapshotResponse`.
